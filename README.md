 # Explore The Mournes

Explore The Mournes is a website that informs users about the Mourne Mountain area and what it can offer to anyone wanting to explore and visit. The website gives the visitor information on seven of the highest peaks of the Mournes, and other distinct places to discover in the surrounding areas. The site also has information on three of the most popular places to go mountain biking. It also offers a subscription to an e-newsletter that keeps you up-to-date on organised events in the peaks, as well as a monthly photography competition with the winners featured each month.
