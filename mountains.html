            <p>
                Slieve Lamagan sits at 704m high.
                Lamagan is the hardest of the Mournes due to the fact it is positioned in the middle.<br>
                Due to this, you have to cross two peaks to reach Lamagans peak which makes the walk harder but so muchmore rewarding.<br> 
                Once reaching the foot of Lamagan the climb is a steep walk to the peak.<br>
                This hike is recommended for experienced hikers. <br>
                You can start this hike at Carrick Little.

                Standing at 702m Slieve Meelbeg is located in the west of the Mournes.<br>
                Meelbeg is the twin of Meelmore due to it being next to each other and you can walk both in half a
                day.<br>
                Meelbeg is the taller of the two.<br>
                Due to the nature of having Meelbeg and Meelmore so close to each other,<br>
                it is highly recommended to do both of them in a walk offering an extra challenge to the walk.<br>
                You can begin your walk from the Trassy car park.

                Meelmore is the shorter of the two peaks.<br>
